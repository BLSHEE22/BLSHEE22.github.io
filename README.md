# NFL Grudge Match Detector
Summary
- An NFL player holds a **grudge** when competing against an ex-team.
- A grudge is considered a **primary grudge** when the ex-team is the player's original team.
  - Players with primary grudges are considered to have 'extra motivation' and so are marked in **<span style="color: red;">red</span>**.<br/>

## Are any NFL players squaring off against their ex-team?
